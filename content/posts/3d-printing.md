Summary
=======

This lesson on 3D printing covered:

1. The common 3D printing technologies – FFF and SLA — as well as their merits
2. Some of the design considerations required when 3D printing
3. Exporting to STLs and why resolution matters
4. Some common print materials (PLA, PETG, and ASA) and their differences
5. Slicing and the tradeoffs between speed and quality
6. The different types of infill, the effect of infill density, and why infill is needed
7. Support structures – where they are needed and how to avoid them where possible
8. Some other slicing terminology (bridging, brim, skirts, and rafts)
9. How to prepare a quick model from Fusion 360 for printing using PrusaSlicer
