Summary
======

This first lesson in PCB design with KiCad covered:

1. Installing KiCad component libraries
2. Navigating electronic component datasheets
3. Picking and placing components using the 'A' and 'P' keybindings
4. Moving, editing, rotating, and copying components with 'M', 'E', 'R', and 'C'
5. Deleting components with 'DEL'
6. Connecting things with wires using 'W'
7. Keeping things tidy using global labels (Ctrl-H)
8. Repeating the last action intelligently with 'INS'
9. Adding a no-connect flag to a pin using 'Q'
10. Automatically annotating (numbering) the components in a schematic
11. Using the Electrical Rules Check (ERC) to find potential errors
12. Assigning physical footprints to schematic components
