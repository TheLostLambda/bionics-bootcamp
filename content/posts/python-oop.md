Summary
=======

This lesson on object-oriented programming in Python covered:

1. Classes as "blueprints" for objects
2. Objects group data (variables) and functionality (methods) 
3. Inheritance allows classes to reuse functionality from existing classes
4. How classes (and other constructs!) can be documented using "docstrings"
5. How to define constructors using `__init__(self)` and how to call them
6. Defining instance and class variables and the difference between the two
7. Defining methods and class methods
8. How to inherit from other classes in Python
9. How to access the methods of a super-class using `super()`
10. Overriding inherited methods for fun and profit

Recording

I got turned around a bit when setting class variables, so I'm sorry about that! Have mercy on me <3
