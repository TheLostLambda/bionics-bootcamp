Summary
======

This second lesson in Arduino programming & circuit building covered:

1. Registering individual button presses (tracking state change)
2. Importing and using Arduino libraries (`#include <...>`)
3. Driving servo motors using the `Servo.h` library (`.attach()` and `.write()`)
4. Repeating actions and counting with `for` loops
5. Building and driving LED arrays with DIP-switches and an Arduino
6. Using nested `for` loops to traverse grids
7. Defining functions to reduce code duplication
8. Reading button presses from a button matrix

Your Challenge
--------------

Using the [partially complete pin-pad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fKLWtGpt8nH) from the end of the session, implement a circuit and program that:

1. Can detect single button presses on the keypad
2. Can keep track of a multi-digit number input from the keypad
3. Sets the servo position equal to the number of degrees specified by the keypad input

Give this a proper go and feel free to use the recording and / or any of the materials linked below. If you really get stuck, or would like to compare your solution to mine, the ["solution" is here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/8RGvzMR2Qva).

Getting Help
============

Even if you've missed the session, you'll be able to ask questions about whatever, whenever on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/N4k7ECt). Feel free to drop your question in the #bootcamp channel or just message an instructor directly.

Recording
=========

I think that this recording is half decent, but you'll have to be the judge of that! Roast me in the feedback form!
