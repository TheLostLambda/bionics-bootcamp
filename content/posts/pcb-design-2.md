Summary
======

This second lesson in PCB design with KiCad covered:

1. Importing a schematic and footprints using 'Tools > Update PCB From Schematic'
2. Drawing board outlines on the 'Edge.Cuts' layer using Pcbnew
3. Creating more complex board outlines using OpenSCAD and importing them as DXF
4. Arranging component footprints using 'M' to move and 'R' to rotate
5. Setting different grid sizes and understanding "pitch"
6. Using 'X' to lay traces and connect components
7. Adding a fill zone / copper pour for GND
8. Designing a silkscreen on the 'F.SlikS' layer
9. Using the Design Rules Check (DRC) to find potential errors
9. Exporting a PCB and drill files for manufacture
10. Ordering a PCB through JLCPCB
