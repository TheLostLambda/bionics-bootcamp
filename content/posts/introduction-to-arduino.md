Summary
======

This first lesson in Arduino programming & circuit building covered:

1. The basic structure of an Arduino program (`setup()` and `loop()`)
2. Waiting for a set amount of time using `delay()`
3. Working with digital outputs (`pinMode()` and `digitalWrite()`)
4. Writing to the Serial console using `Serial.begin()` and `Serial.println()`
5. Potentiometers (variable resistors) and how they can be used in a circuit
6. Reading analogue inputs with `analogRead()`
7. The use and importance of pull-up / pull-down resistors and the danger of "floating" pins
8. Reading binary voltages with `digitalRead()`
9. The operating principle of PWM and how it can be used to "fake" an analogue output voltage
10. Using PWM pins on an Arduino with `analogWrite()`

In the end we made it through a number of Arduino tutorials with some additional content sprinkled in. Next week we'll apply our newfound knowledge to a more complex project.

Getting Help
============

Even if you've missed the session, you'll be able to ask questions about whatever, whenever on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/N4k7ECt). Feel free to drop your question in the #bootcamp channel or just message an instructor directly.

Recording
=========

I think that this recording is half decent, but you'll have to be the judge of that! Roast me in the feedback form!
