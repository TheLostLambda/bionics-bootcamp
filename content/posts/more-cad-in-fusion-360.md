2. Making more complex holes with the hole tool
3. Creating swept features with a profile and path
4. Smoothly transitioning between different cross-sectional profiles with loft
5. Creating circularly symmetric features with revolve
6. Exporting bodies as STLs for 3D printing
7. Preparing parts for printing using PrusaSlicer
8. Dividing 3D models into layers fit for laser cutting
9. Projecting 3D bodies as 2D sketches
10. Exporting sketches as DXF files and post-processing them in Inkscape
