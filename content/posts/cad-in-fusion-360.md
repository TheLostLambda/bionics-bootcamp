Exercises
---------

Here are some [practice designs to replicate in Fusion 360](/bionics-general/resources/CAD%20Exercises.pdf) and here are [the solutions](/bionics-general/resources/CAD%20Exercises%20Answers.pdf). We'll go over a couple more of these in the second week, but not all of them, so feel free to get some practice in!
