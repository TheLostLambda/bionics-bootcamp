## Short Description
Many passionate students join Sheffield Bionics every year, but often lack the technical background needed to keep up with the more senior members. With that being said, it's vitally important to us that everyone who wants to take part in Bionics has the means to do so. Bionics Bootcamp is a new program designed to get fresh recruits and senior members alike up to speed with programming, electronics, and mechanical design.

## Who We Need
We are open to anyone with a passion for bionics – regardless of experience or background! New members will be strongly encouraged to go through the first semester of the program, but are free to dip in and out as they see fit. Likewise, existing members of bionics are strongly encouraged to come along and learn something new!

The program also strives to introduce the other sub-teams of Bionics and help indecisive new members find the sub-team(s) best suited to their skills and interests.

## The Plan

### Session Structure
Most sessions will consist of around an hour of interactive instruction followed by an optional second hour of "tutorial" time during which students can ask questions, share ideas, and / or work on projects applying what they've learned. These sessions take place once a week for 10 weeks throughout each semester.

To accommodate learners of all skill-levels, each session will be divided into introductory and advanced topics. The introductory level will be taught in-person while the higher-levels are delivered through video tutorials and worksheets that allow advanced students to set their own pace.

### Semester 1 – The Essentials
The goal of the first semester is to help new members build the foundation they need to meaningfully contribute to the other teams within the society. Each week aims to build on the content of previous sessions, but should still be accessible to students just looking to drop in.

A tentative structure of the 10 week course is laid out below:
  1) An Introduction to Programming in Python
  2) Object Oriented Programming in Python & Modern Python Scripts
  3) Git & Version Control
  4) Electrical Circuits & Breadboard Basics
  5) Programming Hardware – Introduction to Arduino
  6) Further Fun With Arduino
  7) 3D Design in Fusion 360
  8) More Modelling in Fusion 360
  9) 3D Printing and Manufacturing in the iForge
  10) Project Showcase

### Semester 2 – Specialist Topics
While the first semester focuses on progressively building up the knowledge that every team member needs, the second semester is comprised of more stand-alone, specialist topics. That is why it is left to the society to decide what topics are most interesting to cover. A few of them are given below as an example.

  * Advanced(ish) 3D Printing
  * Object Oriented Programming in Python
  * Machine Learning (Data Shaping & Preparation)
  * Machine Learning (Model Choice & Implementation)
  * Machine Learning (Model Evaluation & Improvements)
  * Machine Learning (The Mathematics behind it all)
  * PCB Design (Schematics & Datasheets)
  * PCB Design (Footprints & Routing)

This is not an exhaustive list and is prone to change. That's where you come in! Help us decide which other topics you'd like to cover this semester!
